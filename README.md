# System Engineering & DevOps

Infrastructure design, system administration, and DevOps practices. Understanding how to build, deploy, and maintain scalable systems.

## Topics

**Web Infrastructure Design:**
- System architecture and design patterns
- Load balancing and high availability
- Database replication and scaling
- Monitoring and redundancy
- Security considerations in infrastructure

## Skills

- Designing resilient infrastructure
- Understanding distributed systems
- Load balancing techniques
- Database scaling strategies
- Infrastructure security best practices

## Security Perspective

Infrastructure knowledge is critical for security work:
- Understanding attack surface in complex architectures
- Identifying single points of failure
- Recognizing misconfigurations
- Network segmentation and defense in depth
- Infrastructure-level vulnerabilities

## Application

DevOps and system engineering skills support:
- Red team infrastructure setup
- Understanding target environments during pentests
- Recognizing architectural vulnerabilities
- Infrastructure security assessments
- Cloud security understanding

Knowing how systems are built helps understand how to attack and defend them effectively.
